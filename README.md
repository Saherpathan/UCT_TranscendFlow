# TranscendFlow: Smart City Traffic Patterns 🚗

This Streamlit application, TranscendFlow, analyzes smart city traffic patterns using machine learning techniques.

## Overview ℹ️

TranscendFlow provides insights into traffic patterns at different junctions in a smart city. It utilizes Linear Regression to predict future traffic based on historical data and adjusts predictions for special occasions, weekends, and holidays.

## Usage 🚀

1. Open the TranscendFlow application.
2. Select a junction from the sidebar options.
3. View actual traffic data and predicted traffic data for the selected junction.
4. Check the adjusted test predictions for the selected junction.
